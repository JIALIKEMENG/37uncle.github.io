 It indeed captures a playful side of ancient Rome. While Caligula's personal life is shrouded in mystery, it's fascinating to think about how Romans expressed their passions through art during that time!
它确实捕捉到了古罗马俏皮的一面。虽然卡利古拉的个人生活笼罩在神秘之中，但想想罗马人在那段时间如何通过艺术表达他们的激情真是令人着迷！

As the Edo period emerged in Japan in 1600, so did the erotic art known as shunga. The word shunga translates literally to "spring pictures," as "spring" was a common euphemism for sex. The illustrations were popular with everyone from rural peasants, who viewed them in lending libraries that traveled through the countryside, to the wealthy ruling class, who paid so much for commissioned pieces that artists could live off of a single drawing for six months.
In 1722, the Japanese government banned shunga — but that didn't stop its circulation. Artists simply stopped signing their pieces so they couldn't be traced back to them, and bookstores sold them under the counter. Shunga's popularity eventually declined in the 19th and 20th centuries with the advent of erotic photography, but it inspired famous artists like Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and remains a key part of Japan's artistic past.
随着江户时代于 1600 年在日本出现，被称为 shunga 的色情艺术也随之而来。shunga 这个词的字面意思是“春天的图片”，因为“春天”是性爱的常见委婉说法。这些插图受到所有人的欢迎，从农村农民到富有的统治阶级，他们为委托作品支付了如此多的费用，以至于艺术家可以靠一幅画生活六个月。
1722 年，日本政府禁止了 shunga——但这并没有阻止它的流通。艺术家们干脆停止在他们的作品上签名，这样他们就无法追溯到他们，书店在柜台下出售它们。随着色情摄影的出现，Shunga 的受欢迎程度最终在 19 世纪和 20 世纪下降，但它启发了巴勃罗·毕加索和亨利·德·图卢兹-劳特累克等著名艺术家，并且仍然是日本艺术历史的重要组成部分。
